Design patterns are like blueprints for solving common problems in software development. They act as reusable solutions, guiding you in structuring your code effectively and efficiently. The world of design patterns is vast, but here's a breakdown of some of the most prominent ones and their key differences:

1. Creational Patterns:

These patterns focus on object creation, providing mechanisms for choosing when and how to instantiate objects. Popular examples include:

    Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.
    Factory: Creates objects without exposing the logic for choosing which specific type of object to create.
    Prototype: Creates new objects by cloning an existing prototype object.
    Builder: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing for customization and variation.
2. Structural Patterns:

These patterns deal with the composition and relationships between objects, aiming to improve flexibility and efficiency. Examples include:

    Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
    Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
    Decorator: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without modifying its original class.
    Proxy: Controls access to another object and provides additional functionality.
3. Behavioral Patterns:

These patterns define communication and interaction mechanisms between objects, focusing on how they collaborate and react to events. Examples include:

    Observer: Defines a one-to-many relationship where one object (subject) notifies multiple objects (observers) about changes in its state.
    Strategy: Enables dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime.
    Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.
    Iterator: Provides a sequential access mechanism to a collection of objects.
Key Differences:

The main difference between these categories lies in their focus:

Creational patterns: Object creation
Structural patterns: Object composition and relationships
Behavioral patterns: Object communication and interaction
